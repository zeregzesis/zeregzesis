About me:

  I'm an Applied Informatics student from Poland, I'm mostly proficient in C++ and Python with basic knowledge of Java, JavaScript and PHP. Most of my projects are either for university or are not worth showing.
  
Work experience so far:

  - 1 month internship at "Orlen Serwis" - programming for PLC(Programmable Logic Controller)
  
  - 1 month internship at "Przemysław Łapiński" - programming in PHP(Lumen)
  
Hobbys:
    
  I enjoy coding little console programs that help me with everyday tasks(too small to be worth puting here) as well as skydiving and board games. I also love to debate people on everything for the sake of argument alone, where I always take the opposite point to them, even if I don't agree with it.
